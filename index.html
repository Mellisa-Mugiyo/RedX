        <h1>Mellisa Mugiyo CV</h1>  
        
        <p>My name is Mellisa Mugiyo,I don't have much exeperience in  
            creating code and using coding libraries to construct computer software but 
            I have skills in  identifying the cause of an issue within a system before amending
            it accordingly. I am always ready to ask for help when I don't understand somethind 
            and this has given me the ability to be capable of doing anything</p>

            <p>I understand that there is no better way of learning than working with challenges,
                hence I am always curious on how I can solve a problem and I have this eagerness to
                learn and passion for solving problems.things that motivates me the most are knowing that I'm going 
                to learn new things everyday,becoming smarter everyday and the thought of working with amazing and talented people.</p>

            <p>I would most likely like to design, develop and test software and ensure software adheres to best practices in performance, 
                reliability and security, and working in developing mobile applications, coding video games, programming websites and much more.
                building general software and web interface .</p>
